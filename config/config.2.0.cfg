"June 25. The bird will be delayed. MagPie (and new PRO ULTRA) is getting a major overhaul and it is taking longer than expected. All brands, CE, STANDARD, PRO and PRO ULTRA uses the same core engines so having this prolongs the development. Look out - the bird will fly. I promiss a slick new unser interface with easy control of import and export.",

"June 17. Final Release will have: Product images will be loaded from the standard WordPress media library. No more uploading via FTP. Pure standard and ease of use.",
"June 17. I am working on PRO ULTRA. Will feature online direct editing of all the CSV files you have saved. Have many shops in your shop this way (one week one line of prices or products - up to you). Just import the CSV file you want to run now. Use MagPie<sup>PRO ULTRA</sup> to manage your store with total freedom. More later.",
"June 15. Final Release will support multi-level export and import of varitions and categories. Via JSON format. Pretty easy. JSON is very powerful so get to know your JSON read here: <a target='_blank' href='http://www.json.org'>www.json.org</a> and here: <a target='_blank' href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON'>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON</a>.

"June 14. MagPie is shipping. I have released the bird to the public. Let it live and be (almost) free. Now a few days no flying for me and then I will start on PRO ULTRA. Who said learning to fly was easy? :-) Happy Shopping, Importing, Exporting and - well - make a plugin that makes a delicious Pizza...",
"June 13. MagPie PRO version 2.0 Release Candidate 1 is flying. After vigourous testing by 3 PRO testers, MagPie is Flying. It has been a long wait... but it is worth it. MagPie PRO is better than ever and is 10x times faster importing. Exporting is near 50x times faster. And import and export is now rock solid. Importing 100 products plus image is no more than 3 minutes or less on a fast server. Improved and spiced up User Interface.",

"June 12. 2011: My new Export engine is faster and rock solid. Will work on the import engine today. Then test the mapping of fields from imported CSV making sure that im- and export runs rock solid and are matched under any circumstance. I do believe I am able to release version 1.2 today before the day is over. All looks very promissing so far and I am very happy with 1.2 which gives strong incentive for the up and coming MagPie PRO ULTRA development.",
"June 11th 2011: I am doing a major overhaul of upcomming release 1.2 so I am delayed. I do not want to rush this bird. So bare with me. Redoing the whole import and export function which will make for properly mapped field CSV values. And much more.",
