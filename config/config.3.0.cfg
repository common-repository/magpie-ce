Then test the mapping of fields from imported CSV making sure that im- and export runs rock solid and are matched under any circumstance.

All looks very promissing so far and I am very happy with 1.2 which gives strong incentive for the up and coming MagPie PRO ULTRA development.",

"tooltips":{
"fieldmapping1":"Map your fieldnames on the left to the ones of WPEC/WP/MagPie on the right. Yours must be set to go into the proper field. Use the pulldown selection and make your choice. MagPie will automatically match your imported CSV file field names (left column) if your field names are found in the internal structure of WPEC and MagPie (right column)<br /><br />If your field name is not automatically matched, then <i>Do nothing with this field</i> is automatically selected. This means that, you will need to manually map an unmatched field from your csv data file to the correct WPEC product field, or that field in your data file will be omitted and not be used.",
